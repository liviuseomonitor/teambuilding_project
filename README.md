# SERP Watchdog

**A dedicated monitoring dashboard for SEO Agencies.**

This application helps SEO Account Managers track the volatility of SERP (Search Engine Results Page) features for their high-value keywords.

## 🎯 Target Audience: The SEO Agency
SEO Agencies need to answer two critical questions for their clients:
1.  *"Why did our traffic drop?"* (Defense)
2.  *"Where can we get more traffic?"* (Offense)

## 💡 How to use this app

### 1. Morning Coffee Scan ☕
**Goal:** Quick health check.
*   **Action:** Manager sorts the Main Table by **Search Volume** to check the client's most important keywords.
*   **Signal:** They look at the **History** sparkline. A "solid block" means stability. A "gappy" or changing pattern implies volatility.

### 2. Investigating Traffic Drops 📉
**Goal:** Explain rank changes.
*   **Scenario:** A client asks why traffic fell for *"best seo software"*.
*   **Action:** The manager checks the specific row.
*   **Insight:** "Ah, I see on Tuesday (3 days ago) an **AI Overview (AIO)** feature appeared, pushing our organic result down." or "A **Video Carousel** appeared above us."
*   **Outcome:** The agency provides a data-backed explanation, not just guesses.

### 3. Spotting "Schema" Opportunities 🚀
**Goal:** Upsell services.
*   **Action:** Scan for keywords where **"FAQ" (Questions)** or **"Video"** icons appear in gray (Present) but the **Rank Badge** is not green (Not Won).
*   **Insight:** "Google is showing videos for this keyword, but *your* video isn't there."
*   **Outcome:** Pitch a video creation or FAQ Schema optimization campaign to the client.

## 🛠 Features
*   **Live Rank Tracking**: Real-time position checks.
*   **SERP Feature History**: 30-day view of visual changes (AI, Ads, Video, Snippets).
*   **Volatility Detection**: Visual cues for when features appear/disappear.
